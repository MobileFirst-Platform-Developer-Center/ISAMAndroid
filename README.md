[http://ibm.biz/mobilefirstisam](http://ibm.biz/mobilefirstisam)

### Usage
1. Use either Maven, MobileFirst CLI or your IDE of choice to [build and deploy the available `ResourceAdapter` adapter](https://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/adapters/creating-adapters/).
The ResourceAdapter adapter can be found in https://github.com/MobileFirst-Platform-Developer-Center/SecurityCheckAdapters/tree/release80.
2.  From a command-line window, navigate to the project's root folder and run the commands:

  * `mfpdev app register` - to register the application.
  * `mfpdev app push` - to map the `accessRestricted` scope to the `LtpaBasedSSO` security check.

3. Update the **config.xml**'s `mfp:server` tag with the IP and port for your configured ISAM server instance.

### Supported Levels
* IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation 8.0
* IBM Security Access Manager 9.0.2
